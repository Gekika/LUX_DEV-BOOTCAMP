    "## Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover interesting patterns, insights, and potential anomalies within the Weather dataset that we used for week 1 Assignment.Please address the following questions and tasks in your analysis:\n",
    "### Data Overview and Cleaning:\n",
    "- What are the key characteristics of the dataset? (e.g., number of records, features, data types)\n",
    "- Identify and handle any missing or null values. Describe your approach and reasoning.\n",
    "- Check for and address any duplicate records.\n",
    "### Statistical Summary:\n",
    "- Provide a statistical summary of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.\n",
    "- Identify and describe any significant outliers in the data.\n",
    "### Data Visualization:\n",
    "- Create visualizations to show the distribution of key weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).\n",
    "- Plot time series graphs to visualize trends over time. Highlight any notable patterns or seasonal variations.\n",
    "- Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between different weather parameters.\n",
    "### Weather Patterns and Trends:\n",
    "- Analyze and describe any trends or patterns you observe in the data. For instance, how do temperature and humidity vary across different seasons or months?\n",
    "I- nvestigate any anomalies or unusual patterns in the data. What might be the reasons for these anomalies?\n",
    "### Insights and Conclusions:\n",
    "- Summarize the key insights you have gained from your EDA. What are the most interesting or surprising findings?\n",
    "- How can these insights be useful for weather prediction or other practical applications?\n",
    "### Recommendations for Further Analysis:\n",
    "- Suggest areas for further analysis or additional data that might be useful to explore.\n",
    "Please present your findings in a well-organized report, including both written explanations and visualizations. Use appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and ensure your code is well-documented and reproducible."
